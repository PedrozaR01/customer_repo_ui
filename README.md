# customer_repo_ui
In this project I'll create a UI to interact with the API "customer_repo". 

I'll be using angular and some typescript, simply explained this UI at most will process data to send it to the API so the API can handle it regardless of the technology used in this UI.

# Requirements
Java 8 
A Java IDE with the Spring Boot plugin and support for Maven Projects
Node Package Manager
Angular and it's CLI
